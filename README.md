My submission will look busted in desktop mode, I apoogize for that. I usually try to put a lot of effort into all my classes but this one is the hardest for me, and I don't plan on going into anything coding related. With my other classes becoming extremely busy, I'll be trying my best to reach for a 50% so I can graduate in December. Sorry again about this.
